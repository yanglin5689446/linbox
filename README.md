### what's this ?
I'm a big fan of Google Inbox and have been using Google Inbox for years, but [Google Inbox service was shut down on April, 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17848500/google-inbox-shut-down-sunset-snooze-email-march-2019) and Inbox users are told to go back to use Gmail, but it seems that even now, Gmail App is still not as user-friendly as Inbox, so I'd like to write a frontend for Gmail API that works just like Inbox, thus Linbox was born.

This repo is in an early stage. Any comments, issues or PRs would be appreciated.
